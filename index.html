            <p class="par">Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. <br>
                The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design);<br>
                authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); <br>
                and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process,<br> 
                although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating <br>
                to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. <br>
                Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an <br>
                awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
